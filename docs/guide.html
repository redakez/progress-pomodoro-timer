         <h2>Application description</h2>
         <p>
            Progress Pomodoro Timer uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro
               technique</a> while while keeping a track of your daily goal.
         </p>
         <h2>How to use</h2>
         <p>First you need to set up your daily goal, which is the total time you plan to spent working each day. This
            is
            done by setting the number of pomodoros and their length in the Settings tab. Usual pomodoro length is 20-30
            minutes. The daily goal is calculated as pomodoro length multiplied by the number of pomodoros. Once you set
            your goal, follow these steps every day (or only some days):</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Start a pomodoro in the Timer tab and work until the pomodoro is completed</li>
            <li>Take a 5-15 minute break</li>
            <li>If your daily goal is not yet met, go to step 1, otherwise you are done working for today</li>
         </ol>
         <p>
            Feel free to experiment with the length of the pomodoro as well as the length of the breaks. It is
            recommented to start with shorter pomodoros if you aren't used to the pomodoro technique.
         </p>
         <h2>Pausing a pomodoro</h2>
         <p>
            The application allows you to pause pomodoros. Ideally this function should not be used at all. However,
            there may come a time when you need to take a break early. If a pomodoro is paused, it may be resumed later
            or it may be finished. If a pomodoro is finished then its progress is added to the daily progress and the
            current pomodoro is reset.
         </p>

         <h2>Logs and progress graph</h2>
         <p>
            The Logs tab contains a table of actions (usually taken by the user), the time of the action and progress at
            that time. The table is also visualized in a progress graph, which shows the daily progress changing with
            time.
         </p>

         <h2>Progress manager</h2>
         <p>
            The manager tab can be used to add or remove time from the daily progress. This feature is meant to be used
            when you either start working and forget to start a pomodoro or when you stop working but forget to pause
            the pomodoro. You can use the Logs tab to estime the time which should be added or removed from the daily
            progress to keep the daily progress accurate.
         </p>

         <h2>Closing the application</h2>
         <p>
            When the application is closed, it stores the current progress and logs to local storage. When the
            application
            is re-opened, it will start with that progress and logs. However, this stored progress expires if the
            application is not opened in the next 12 hours. This is so that the progress is reset on the next day.
         </p>

         <h2>Desktop notification</h2>
         <p>
            Desktop notifications can be enabled in the Settings tab. A notification is send each time a pomodoro
            finishes. You can also turn on eye rest notifications. If this setting is turned on, you recieve a
            notification each 20 minutes the timer is running (since the timer starts) instructing you to rest your
            eyes. In order to prevent eyesight damage, it is recommended to look into a distance for at least 20 seconds
            every 20 minutes.
